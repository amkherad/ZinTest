# ZinTest
[Work In Progress]

ZinTest is a testing platform with it's own fully-observable language. It's goal is to allow
users to write a test case in an abstract language easily and without need for re-implementation in another language/platform if you have the same scenario in a different language/platform.

Another aspect of ZinTest is that it has isolation levels, so you can run tests multiple times without being worried about the effects of each test on the original or test data.
